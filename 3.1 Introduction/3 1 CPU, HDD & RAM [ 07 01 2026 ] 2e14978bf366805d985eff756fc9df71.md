# 3.1 CPU, HDD & RAM [ 07/01/2026 ]

---

## CPU

- The Most Important component of a Computer → Brain of Computer → CPU
- CPU is made of Billions of Transistors
- Transistors understands only 2 things
    - Low Voltage/Current → 0V → 0 [ Software Terminology ]
    - HIgh Voltage/Current → 5V → 1  Software Terminology ]
- CPU is DUMB [ Hence, we say Computers are Dumb ]
    - why..?
    - because, CPU itself cannot do anything on it’s own
    - It needs to be instructed on what to do & How to do Things
    - And this needs to be instructed in Binary Language [ as CPU can only understand 0 & 1 ]
- But CPU is Very Fast
    - i.e., CPU can process & execute the instructions very fast & gives the Output

MLL →Writing Instructions in machine understandable language [ i.e., Binary form ]

ALL →Writing Instructions in Nuemotics [ i.e., ADD, SUB, MUL etc.. ]

ALL →Writing Instructions in English Words & Symbols [ i.e., ADD, SUB, MUL etc.. ]

Assembler → Software which Converts ALL to MLL

Compiler → Software which Converts HLL to MLL

## HDD & RAM

- WKT, CPU will execute the instructions very fast
- But, How will CPU get the Instructions
    - Ofcourse, we will give the instructions for CPU
        - But, how will we give those?
    - We cannot directly write the instructions one by one to CPU
    - Cause, we are giving as a set of instructions in the form of programs
    - These Programs needs to be stored somewher & then sent to CPU for execution
- This Storage unit { on our computer } is called HDD [ Hard Disk Drive ]

***HDD***

- HDD stores the Data [ programs ] that needs to be processed & executed by CPU
- Data from HDD will be sent to CPU via BUS
- HDD is made up of Electro-Mechanical Tech & Magnectic Tech
    - Due to this tech, HDD are very slow in nature [ compared to CPU ]
    - So data will be sent slowly to CPU
    - As CPU is very fast, CPU will execute the data & will be waiting for next instructions to reach it
- Here, CPU is capable of working fast but HDD is NOT capable of sending it
    - ANALOGY → Adding Ferari Engine to Bullock Cart
- So, it makes Computer less Efficient
- DisAdv
    - Slow [ hence, makes less Efficient  ]
    - Bulky
    - Noisy

***RAM***

- Due to Major Drawback of HDD [ slow & less effificient ], RAM is invented
    - The differences in HDD & CPU is the tech by which those are made
        - CPU is made of Semi Conductor Tec → Fast
        - HDD is made up of Magnectic Tech → Slow
    - Hence, RAM was made up of Semi Conductor tech to match speeds of CPU
- RAM stores the Data [ programs ] that needs to be processed & executed by CPU
- RAM sends the data fastly & CPU executes those fastly [ without any waiting period ] → NO Speed Mismatch
- BUT, the major Drawback is
    - RAM is VOLATILE
        - Volatile means, continuous power supply is required to work
        - If power supply is lost for a fraction of second → All the data that is stored on RAM will be gone permanently
    - RAM is very expensive

Hence Scientists realized that HDD is very Useful

- Since HDD is Non-Volatile
- i.e., irrespective of Power supply, All the data that is stored on HDD is permanently Stored
    - Hence, data is called Persistent data
    - And HDD is called Persistent Storage Device

So, both HDD & RAM are used to send data to CPU for execution

- HDD is connected to RAM [ via BUS ]
    - Sending the data from HDD to RAM → Loading
    - This data on RAM is Volatile
- RAM is connected to CPU [ via BUS ]
    - Sending the data from RAM to HDD → Saving
    - This data on HDD is persistent [ Non-Volatile ]
- Since RAM acts as storage device for CPU execution, it is called Primary Memory
- Since RAM acts as storage device for RAM, it is called Secondary Memory
