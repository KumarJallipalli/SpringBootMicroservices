## History of Programming Languages

- We have Computers in many forms → Desktop Computers, Laptops, Smart Phones, Electronic Devices etc..
- Brain of Computer is Processor [ Processor, CPU, Micro Processor → All refer to same thing ]
    - Image a Human in coma with all other body parts working is of NO Use
    - Similarly, Computer without CPU is of NO Use
- Processor/CPU is made up of Biliions of Transistors
- This Processor/CPU can only Understand 2 states
    - 0 → NO Current flows
    - 1 → Current flows
    - This is due to Transistors & this represents Binary [ 0 & 1 ]
    - So all the Operations like Addition, subtraction, etc.. are given in Binary Language called Machine Level Language [ MLL ]
- This MLL is very difficult to write, Understand & debug programs
    - A Program is a Set of Instructions given to a Computer to perform a Specific Task
- Hence, a New way of Programming is developed where instead of Binary codes, Nuemonics [ like SUB for Subtraction, ADD for Addition etc.. ] are used
    - As CPU can only understand Binaries,
        - An Assembler is developed to convert these neumonics to Binaries
    - This Language where Nuemonics are used to give instructions is called Assembly Level Language [ ALL ]
- This ALL also has many drawbacks just like MLL
- Hence, a New way of Programming is developed where instead of Nuemonics, actual English words & Symbols [ +, -, * etc.. ] are used
    - As CPU can only understand Binaries,
        - A Compiler  is developed to convert these English Words & Symbols to Binaries
    - This Language where English words & Symbols are used to give instructions is called High Level Language [ HLL ]
- In this way Modern Programming Languages called HLL are Developed

## Transistor

- A Transistor is **a tiny semiconductor device**
    - They **control the flow of electrical signals**, enabling the chip to process and store information.
    - How..?
        - A transistor consists of three terminals: the **base**, **collector**, and **emitter**.
        - If there is **no current** at the base, the transistor acts like a closed switch → No current flows between the collector and emitter.
        - If there is a **current** at the base, the transistor opens up → Current flows through.
    - This ability to control electrical current allows transistors to work as a switch (switching things on and off) or as an amplifier (making signals stronger).
        - As a **switch**: Transistors can rapidly turn on and off, representing binary states (0 and 1) that form the foundation of digital computing.
        - As an **amplifier**: Transistors can also be used to boost weak electrical signals.
        - Hence, Transistors **acts as an electronic switch or amplifier**
    - In digital electronics, transistors are used in large numbers to build **logic gates**.
        - These form the foundation of computer processors.
        - By switching on and off very quickly, transistors help process the binary code that computers use to operate.

NOTE:

- Transistors are Very Fast

## BUS

- A computer bus is a **high-speed electronic pathway (a set of wires or circuits)** used to transfer data between components within a computer or between different computers
- Hence it is aka communication system
- Working:
    - When the CPU needs data from the HDD,
    - it sends a request through the System Bus to the chipset, which directs it to the HDD's interface bus (e.g., SATA).
    - The HDD then sends the requested data back along these buses to the CPU, often via RAM.
- **Key Functions:**
    - **Data Sharing:** Moves actual information between components. → Data BUS
    - **Addressing:** Specifies where data should go or come from. → Address BUS
    - **Control:** Manages the timing and synchronization of operations. → Control BUS

## HDD

- CPU can Only Execute the Instructions,
    - But CANNOT Store those Instructions
    - Hence, we need to Store these Instructions & then send it to CPU to get executed
    - Here comes HDD & BUS
        - HDD → To Store the Instructions
        - CPU → To Execute the Instructions
        - BUS → To Transfer the Instructions from HDD to CPU
- HDD→Hard Disk Drive
    - HDD are made up of Magnetic Tapes
    - By Nature, This Magnetic Tape technology is Slower
    - But WKT, CPU is made up of Semi Conductors
        - Hence by Nature, CPU’s are Very Fast
- So, this HDD is connected to CPU via BUS
    - But WKT, HDD is slow in Nature,
    - So, Instructions will be sent slowly to CPU
    - CPU will execute the instrution & wait for other instructions to reach CPU from HDD [ for further execution ]
        - ANALOGY → Attaching Ferari engine [ CPU ] to Bullock Cart [ HDD ]
- WKT, CPU is Very Fast due to Semi Conductor Tech
    - So, Scientists though of using same tech to store the instructions
    - Hence, a new Storage system called RAM was invented

## RAM

- RAM is made up of Semi Conductors tech
- So, it is also very fast
- RAM is connected to CPU using BUS
- So, CPU Executes the instructions immediately one after other [ No waiting ]
- BUT,
    - The biggest drawback of RAM is “VOLATILE”
        - i.e., Continue Power supply is required for RAM to work
        - Once power supply gone for a fraction of second as well → All the data will be gone
    - HDD’s Biggest advantage → NON-VOLATILE
- Hence, Scientist went back to HDD & made use of both world
- So, HDD is connected to RAM & RAM is connected to CPU via BUS’s
    - This is the reason, RAM is called Primary Memory
        - As CPU takes data from RAM
    - HDD is called Secondary Memory
        - As RAM takes data from HDD
        - This is called “LOADING”
            - LOADING→ Copying data from ROM to RAM
            - SAVING → Copying data from RAM to ROM
