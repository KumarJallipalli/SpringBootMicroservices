# 4.1 OOP Intro [ 27/01/2026 ]

---

WKT,

- Java is Strongly/Statistically Typed Language
    - Helps to Reduce Errors [ by catching Errors before execution i.e., during Compilation ]
- Java is Object Oriented Programming Language
    - Helps to Convert Real word Scenarios into Coding Easily [ by defining what it HAS & what it DO’s ]

## Class & Object

- Class is a Blueprint
- Object is Instance of the Class
- Analogy:
    - We need a House to stay/live
    - To Construct a House,
        - A Blueprint is required
        - But we can’t stay/live inside the Blueprint
        - We need to Construct the actual House using that Blueprint
    - Similarly, Class is of NO-USE to us,
    - Unless we create an Object using Class

Class Creation

```java
class Student {
    int id;
    String name;
    int age;

    void studying () {
        System.out.println("Student is Studying");
    }

    void sleeping () {
        System.out.println("Student is Sleeping");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Siva..!");

        Student st1 = new Student();    // --> Object Creation
        st1.sleeping();                 // Accessing Methods using dot (.) Operator
        st1.studying();
    }
}
```

Object Creation

- It is also Known as → Instantiation

**`*Student st1 = new Student();*`**

- **`Student` (Data Type/Class Name):**
    - Defines that the variable `st1` which refers to an object of the class type `Student`.
- **`st1` (Variable Name):**
    - This is the name of the object variable (instance) you are creating.
    - You can use this name to access student data or methods later (e.g., `st1.getName()`).
- **`=` (Assignment Operator):**
    - Takes the new object created on the right and assigns it to the variable `st1` on the left.
- **`new` (Keyword):**
    - A Java operator that allocates new memory space on the heap for the object.
- **`Student()` (Constructor):**
    - Calls the constructor of the `Student` class to initialize the object.
    - The `()` indicates a default (no-argument) constructor.

## Java Execution

- WKT,
    - Any Program/Application to get Executed by CPU/Processor,
    - It must be loaded onto RAM/Memory
- But for any Java Program to be executed by CPU, JRE [ Java Runtime Environment ] is Required
    - This JRE is an Application required to Run/Execute Java
    - JRE contains JVM & Javac [ Both are different ]
    - JVM executes any Java Program
    - JVM conatins Data Areas [ like Stack, Heap, Method Area etc.. ] to Store Data
- Java Program Execution
    - Java Program [ `hello.java` ] converted to Byte code using Java Compiler → Javac
    - This `hello.class` byte code is executed by JVM
    - This all Process is happening on JRE

## Instance Variables (vs) Local Variables

Instance Variables

- Instance Variables are Directly Declared inside a Class
- For Instance Variables, Memory is allocated inside Heap Area [ during Object/Instance Creation ]
- This Instance Variables Memory is De-Allocated by Garbage Collector [ when that Object has No Reference ]
- Scope of Instance Variable is within Class
- Instance Variables will be Intialized with Default Values

Local Variables

- Local Variables are Directly Declared inside a Method/Block [ which are further inside a Class ]
- For Local Variables, Memory is allocated inside Stack Area [ during Method/Block Execution ]
- This Local Variables Memory is De-Allocated once Method/Block execution is completed
    - Since when Method execution is completed, Then that Method will be De-Allocated from Stack Frame/Area ]
    - But Instance Variables are Still Available inside the Memory, until it was collected by Garbage Colletor
- Scope of Local Variable is within Block/Method
- Local Variables will NOT be Intialized with Default Values
