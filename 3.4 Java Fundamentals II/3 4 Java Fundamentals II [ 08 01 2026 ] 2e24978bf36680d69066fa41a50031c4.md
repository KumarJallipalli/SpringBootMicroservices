# 3.4 Java Fundamentals II [ 08/01/2026 ]

## Data Type

- Data Type determines
    1. What type of data a Variable can Hold
    2. How much of Storage/Space should be allocated in Memory for that Variable

## Char

- Initially ASCII found out that
    - there are totally 128 Characters which are most commonly Used
    - It Inlcudes → All special Characters, a-z, A-Z, 0-9 etc..
    - So, to represent these 128 characters → 8 bits are Required ⇒ 1 Byte
    - i.e., Languages which follow ASCII will require 1 Byte of Memory for Char data type
    - char → 1 Byte [ like C, C++ ]
- Later IEEE found out that
    - there were more than 128 Characters [ like Hindi chars, Telugu chars, Chinese chars etc.. ]
    - These chars are around 65536 chars & are termed as Unicode Chars [ as it follows UTF standards ]
    - So, to represent these 65536 characters → 16 bits are Required ⇒ 2 Bytes
    - i.e., Languages which follow UTF will require 2 Bytes of Memory for Char data type
    - char → 2 Byte [ like Java ]

## Code Snippets

```java
        // Type Conversion Example
        byte a = 10;
        byte b = 20;
        // byte c = a + b;             // Error
        byte d = (byte)(a + b);     // Explicit casting

        int n1 = 12;
        int n2 = 5;

        double result1 = n1 / n2;    
        System.out.println(result1); // Outputs 2.0

        double result2 = (double)n1 / n2;
        System.out.println(result2); // Outputs 2.4

				// Unary Operators Examples
        int x = 5;
        int y;
        y = ++x + x++ + ++x + ++x + x++ + --x + --x + x--;
        System.out.println(x);  // Outputs 7
        System.out.println(y);  // Outputs 63

        int p = 5;
        int q;
        q = --p + --p + p-- + p++ + ++p - ++p;
        System.out.println(p);  // Outputs 7
        System.out.println(q);  // Outputs 11
        
        
        // Relational and Logical Operators with Short Circuting
        System.out.println((10 == 4) || (10 < 4) || (10 > 4));
        
        int i = 5;
        int j = 10;
        System.out.println((i < j) || (++i < ++j) || (i++ < j++));
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(j);
        System.out.println((i > j) || (++i < ++j) || (i++ < j++));
        System.out.println(i);
        System.out.println(j);
```

## Note:

- When an Opereation is involved between numbers,
    - Java will implicitly type convert that result to highest type
        - i.e., the Reason, `byte c = a + b;` gets error
        - As 10+20 = 30 is converted to `Int` type & we are assigning `int` to `byte` type
- Resultant of a Relational Operations is Always a `Boolean` type
- Take Care of **Short-Circuit** during evaluation of Realational AND & OR operations
    - `(i > j) || (++i < ++j) || (i++ < j++)` where i=5 & j=10
