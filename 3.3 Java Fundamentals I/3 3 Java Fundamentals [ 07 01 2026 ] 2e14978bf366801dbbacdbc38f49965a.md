# 3.3 Java Fundamentals [ 07/01/2026 ]

---

## Java

- Java is developed by James Gosling [ under Sun MicroSystems ]
- Java is Free & Open Source [ until Java6 & from java7 it is Closed source & maintained by Oracle ]
- Java is Object Oriented Programming
- Java is Statically/Strongly Typed Programming Language
    - Type Must be declared Explicitly,
    - Once declared, Type cannot be changed && Cannot hold other types
    - Types are checked at compile time
- Java is Portable [ Platform Independent, WORA, Architechtural nuetral ]
    - But JVM is Platform Dependent

| Feature | Statically Typed | Dynamically Typed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type checking | Compile time | Runtime |
| Type Declaration | Explicit | Implicit |
| Type safety | High [ CANNOT change & hold other types ] | Lower [ CAN change & hold other types ] |
| Performance | Faster | Slower (usually) |
| Flexibility | Lower | Higher |

## Variables

- **Variable →Container used to store data**
- Each variable has a specific
    - data type → Determines the Type & Size of data ti be stored in Memory
    - name → Identifier
    - value → data
- Identifier → Name of Variables [ & it’s Unique ]
    - Identifier Rules:
        - Names must begin with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`).
            - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
        - Names cannot be a Java keyword (e.g., `int`, `class`, `if`).
        - Names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different variables).
        - Names Follow "camelCase"

```java
int score; // Declaration
score = 4; // Initialization (assignment of a value)
```

## First Program

```java
class Hello {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello JDK..!");
    }
}
```

## Points to Remember

- Everything is written within Functions/Methods only
- Main Method is Starting Point of Execution
    - Without main method, No execution
